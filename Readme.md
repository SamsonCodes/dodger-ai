This is a game I made in Java with a special feature: an AI that learns to play it.

It works with a neural network that is generated by a genetic algorithm.

Instructions:
You can play the game yourself by pressing Play in the menu. At any time during the game you can press ESCAPE to return to the menu.
To use the AI simply select AI in the menu. Then choose the parameters in the screen that pops up or leave them as they are and press the Start button.
You will then enter the Evolution State in which the neural network population evolves to generate better AIs. You can interrupt this state at any time by pressing the interrupt button after the data of previous generations, if any exists, has been loaded. That's right, the data is saved so you can continue the evolution process of a population with the same parameters at any time. Anyways, after the Evolution State finishes you will enter the Game State, but this time the AI will be playing.
During the Game State with the AI you can use the 1, 2 and 3 buttons to toggle between network display modes. You can also press ESCAPE and return to the menu.
